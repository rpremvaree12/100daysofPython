Here’s a sample **Choose Your Own Adventure** story branch from the perspective of a first-year public school teacher. It focuses on managing a classroom situation while balancing professionalism with empathy. This particular branch takes place during the first few weeks of school.

### **Scenario: Classroom Disruption**

You’ve just started your first year of teaching at Riverside Middle School. It’s been a tough day, but you're determined to make it through. You’re teaching an eighth-grade English class, and you’ve barely gotten through the lesson before one of your more disruptive students, Ethan, begins acting out. He’s been talking loudly, making jokes at inappropriate times, and distracting the rest of the class. You’ve tried asking him to stop multiple times, but it’s not working. The class is getting restless, and the other students are starting to lose focus.

---

### **Step 1: What do you do?**

The rest of the class is watching to see how you’ll handle the situation. You can feel the pressure mounting, and you need to act fast before things get out of hand.

- **A)** Raise your voice and give Ethan a stern warning in front of the class. You’ll establish authority right away.  
- **B)** Call Ethan aside for a private conversation after class to see if something’s bothering him.  
- **C)** Try to engage Ethan by asking him to contribute to the lesson. Maybe redirecting his energy will help.

---

### **Step 2: If you chose A (stern warning)**

You snap at Ethan, raising your voice slightly to get the class’s attention. "Ethan, I need you to stop distracting the class right now. If you continue, I’ll have to send you to the principal’s office."

Ethan looks startled for a moment, and the class goes quiet. A few students shift uncomfortably in their seats. Ethan stares at you, then huffs and folds his arms. He mutters something under his breath.

- **A1)** Stay firm and continue the lesson, hoping the warning worked.  
- **A2)** Apologize to Ethan privately after class to smooth things over.

---

### **Step 3: If you chose B (private conversation)**

You decide to take a calmer approach. "Ethan, can you step outside with me for a moment?"

Once outside, you ask him if everything is okay. You learn that he’s been struggling at home with his parents’ recent divorce. This isn’t the first time he’s acted out—he’s been having trouble focusing in other classes too.

- **B1)** Suggest to Ethan that you’ll work together to improve his behavior and offer to help with his schoolwork if he needs it.  
- **B2)** Express sympathy but also set clear expectations that the behavior must improve, or there will be consequences.

---

### **Step 4: If you chose C (engage him in the lesson)**

You decide to try something different and ask Ethan if he wants to come up and help you with an example on the whiteboard. He’s surprised, but you can tell he enjoys being the center of attention. He takes the marker and starts scribbling an answer, clearly energized.

- **C1)** Use this momentum to turn the lesson into a more interactive activity for the class, involving Ethan and the other students.  
- **C2)** Allow Ethan to contribute but keep the class on track with minimal interruptions.

---

### **Step 5: Consequences of Your Choice**

- **If you chose A1 (stay firm)**: Ethan continues to sit quietly for the remainder of the class, but you notice he seems resentful. He doesn’t make eye contact, and when the bell rings, he rushes out without saying a word. You’ve established authority, but you haven’t addressed the root cause of his behavior.

- **If you chose A2 (apologize)**: After class, you apologize to Ethan for snapping at him in front of everyone. He seems relieved, and the conversation about his struggles at home helps build trust. You both agree to a plan for him to get back on track, but it will take time and effort.

- **If you chose B1 (offer help)**: Ethan appreciates your offer to help, and he starts turning in his assignments on time. While his behavior still needs work, his grades improve, and you both develop a better relationship. He begins participating more in class, even when it’s hard for him.

- **If you chose B2 (set expectations)**: You’ve set clear boundaries with Ethan, and he seems to understand. His behavior improves a little, but you continue to check in with him throughout the semester. It’s a slow process, but he’s starting to show progress.

- **If you chose C1 (interactive activity)**: The class has a lot of fun, and Ethan, along with his classmates, seems more engaged. His behavior doesn’t improve overnight, but this approach helps create a more positive classroom atmosphere. You plan to incorporate more interactive activities going forward.

- **If you chose C2 (minimal interruptions)**: You manage to keep Ethan focused with minimal disruptions, and he eventually settles down. However, you’re not sure if the underlying issue is addressed. You’ll need to follow up with him soon.

### Conclusion:

Each choice leads to a different outcome for both Ethan and you as a teacher. Whether you take a strict or empathetic approach, or use creative teaching methods, you’ll learn that teaching isn’t just about managing the class—it’s about understanding your students and adapting your approach. The road to becoming a great teacher is paved with trial, error, and reflection.

This is just one branch, and as you continue making decisions, the narrative will branch out in different ways. You could add elements like parent-teacher meetings, school events, or more student-related challenges to further develop the game.
