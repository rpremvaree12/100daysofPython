# Hi! Welcome!

This repo consists of the projects that I'm writing by following a Udemy Course called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp." The idea is to build 100 projects - some simple, some more complex - over the course of 100 days. While I feel I have a pretty good foundation, I'm interested in having a comprehensive spread of projects and seeing how the concepts build on of each other as well as figure out ways to make the projects my own.

This readme is tracking my progress and including any new learnings here.
